I Apply threshold "dumbly"
    Less customisation possible

II Mathematical function for non static threshold
    the more parameter to the function, the more possible customization

III Voronoi ?
    Generate a voronoi diagram (W/ an array of "points" as seed randomly generated by CPU).
        For each point assign index to closest point (faster access later on)
        or store distance ? both ?
    Decide wether it's land or water based on distance to point + water 
        Add negative space points ?
        Pros:
